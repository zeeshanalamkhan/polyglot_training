# Go `net/http` Package Overview

The `net/http` package is a core part of Goâ€™s standard library, providing everything needed to build HTTP servers and clients. It's a fundamental package for building web applications, REST APIs, microservices, and interacting with HTTP-based services.

## Key Features of `net/http`:

1. **HTTP Server**:  
   The `net/http` package allows you to easily create a simple and powerful HTTP server that listens on a specific port and responds to incoming requests.

2. **HTTP Client**:  
   It also provides a convenient way to make outbound HTTP requests to other web services or APIs, making it perfect for integrating with external services.

## Running the Example

To run the example provided in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Go Application**:
   ```bash
   go run golang/nethttp-intro/main.go
   ```

2. **Make a Request**:
   You can use `curl` to send a request to the server:
   ```bash
   curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/'
   ```

This will start the server on port `8080` and handle incoming requests.
