# Middleware
Middleware is like a helper that sits between your web server and your application. Itâ€™s a piece of code that can do things like check if a user is logged in, log requests, or modify data before the main part of your app handles it. You can think of it as a checkpoint where you can add extra rules or actions for incoming requests before they reach your main application.
